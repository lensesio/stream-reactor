## Release Notes

**2.0.0**

*   Move to Scala 2.12
*   Move to Kafka 2.4.1 and Confluent 5.4

Deprecated:
    * Druid Sink (not scala 2.12 compatible)
    * Elastic Sink (not scala 2.12 compatible)
    * Elastic5 Sink(not scala 2.12 compatible)

*   Redis
    *   Add support for Redis Streams

*   Cassandra
    *   Add support for setting the LoadBalancer policy on the Cassandra Sink

*   ReThinkDB
    *   Use SSL connection on Rethink initialize tables is ssl set

*   FTP Source
    *   Respect "connect.ftp.max.poll.records" when reading slices

*   MQTT Source
    *   Allow lookup of avro schema files with wildcard subscriptions
  

**1.2.7**

**Features**
*   MQTT Source
    
    Support dynamic topic names in Kafka from a wildcard subscription.
    
    Example: INSERT INTO `$` SELECT * FROM /mqttSourceTopic/+/test
    
    If the MQTT topic is /mqttSourceTopic/A/test this Will result in topics in kafka 
    mqttSourceTopic_A_test
    
*   Cassandra (source)
    *   Support for sending JSON formatted message (with string key) to kafka topic.
    
        Sample KCQL would be like:
        
        `INSERT INTO <topic> SELECT <fields> FROM <column_family> PK <PK_field> WITHFORMAT JSON WITHUNWRAP INCREMENTALMODE=<mode> WITHKEY(<key_field>)`
        
        This would send field's values as JSON object to the said topic.
        
        Note that in kafka connect properties one needs to set `key.converter` and `value.converter` as `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter`
         
    * Added a new INCREMENTALMODE called dsesearchtimestamp that will make a DSE Search queries using Solr instead of a native Cassandra query.

        Instead of the native query:

        SELECT a, b, c, d FROM keyspace.table WHERE pkCol > ? AND pkCol <= ? ALLOW FILTERING;
        We will have now the query with Solr on the dsesearchtimestamp INCREMENTALMODE:

        SELECT a, b, c, d FROM keyspace.table WHERE solr_query=?;
        Where the solr_query will be something like this:

        pkCol:{2020-03-23T15:02:21Z TO 2020-03-23T15:30:12.989Z]
        
*   AzureDocumentDB

    *   Move to version 2.x since 1.x is deprecated in May 2020
        
**Bug fixes**

*   JMS Source

    Allow for tasks parallelization and how the connector tasks parallelization is decided.
    
    Changes:
    *  Allow the connector to respect the `tasks.max` value provided if the user `connect.jms.scale.type`. Available values are `kcql` and `default`.
    If `KCQL` is provided it will be based on the number of KCQL statements written, otherwise it will be driven based on the connector `tasks.max`

*   Kudu Sink
    
    Handle null decimal types correctly
    
*   Mongo Sink

    Handle decimal types

**1.2.4**
**Bug fixes**

*   JMS Source

    Ack the JMS messages was not always possible. Also there was an issue with producing the messages to Kafka out of order from the JMS queue. 
    Changes:
    
    *  Queue messages order are retained when published to Kafka (although they might be routed to different partitions)
    *  Ack happens for each message. This is a change from previous behaviour.
    *  Records which fail to be committed to Kafka are not ack-ed on JMS side

**1.2.3**

    *   Support for referencing _key values
    *   Support Unix timestamp as double
