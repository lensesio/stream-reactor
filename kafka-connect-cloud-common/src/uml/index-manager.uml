title Locking and Offset Management Process (with progressive pendingOperation updates)

actor "Kafka Connect Task" as Task
participant "S3/GCP Storage" as Storage
participant "Lock File (lockfile_topic_partition.json)" as LockFile

== Step 0: Initialization ==
Task -> Task : Create unique task UUID for topic/partition combination
Task -> LockFile : Check if lockfile_topic_partition.json exists

alt Lockfile does not exist
    Task -> LockFile : Create new lockfile_topic_partition.json
    Task -> Task : Proceed with processing from committedOffset = 0
else Lockfile exists
    Task -> Task : Load existing lockfile JSON
    Task -> Task : Extract committedOffset and pendingOperations

    alt pendingOperations exist
        loop For each operation in pendingOperations
            Task -> Task : Process operation (upload, copy, delete)
            Task -> LockFile : Remove completed operation from pendingOperations
        end
    else No pending operations
        Task -> Task : Seek to committedOffset, continue processing
    end
end

== Step 2: Process and Write Records ==
Task -> Task : Write records to local file
Task -> Task : Finished writing local_file_uuid[100,5000]

== Step 3: Upload File to S3 ==
Task -> Storage : Upload local_file_uuid[100,5000] to S3
Task -> LockFile : Add "upload" to pendingOperations in lockfile

== Step 4: Validate Offset Consistency ==
Task -> LockFile : Read current lockfile_topic_partition.json
Task -> Task : Ensure committedOffset (100) matches start offset of uploaded file (100)

alt Offset matches
    == Step 5: Finalize Uploaded File ==
    Task -> LockFile : Add "copy" and "delete" to pendingOperations
    Task -> Storage : Copy local_file_uuid[100,5000]_on_s3 to topic_partition_5000
    Task -> LockFile : Remove "copy" from pendingOperations
    Task -> Storage : Delete local_file_uuid[100,5000]_on_s3
    Task -> LockFile : Remove "delete" from pendingOperations
    Task -> LockFile : Update committedOffset = 5000
    Task -> LockFile : Set pendingState = null
    Task -> Task : Continue processing
else Offset mismatch
    Task -> Task : Abort update, discard local file
end
