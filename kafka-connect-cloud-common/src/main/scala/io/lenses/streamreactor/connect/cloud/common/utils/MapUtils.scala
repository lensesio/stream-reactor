    * Kafka Connect provides properties both in the SinkTask.start as

    * This is done because the context properties can contain newer values for items like secret
    * Get the Task configuration. This is the latest configuration and may differ from that passed on startup. For example, this method can be used to obtain the latest configuration if an external secret has changed, and the configuration is using variable references such as those compatible with org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigTransformer.
